"""
Input file format is as follows:

three integers
two strings (occurs 1 or more times)

EXAMPLE
1 2 3
hello goodbye
yes no
true false
happy happier

#open file for input (reading mode)
#if file is in same location as source (Python) code you only have to specify file name and not path

# then choose Reload from Disk

#     str1, str2 = line.split()

###Michael Weinberg - Warmup assignment TCSS 504

Source file - main.py

PROBLEMS:
    I noticed that when I was trying to check for whether a certain index existed, I couldn't do is my_array[k-1] if k
    was 0 then it would increment the last item in the array instead of doing nothing - as I expected.

    Also my greatest nemesis throughout the whole assignment was getting an "index out of bounds" error - which forced me to
    need to think through how I was setting all my tiles.

Total time spent: 7 hours
